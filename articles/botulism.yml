    A government agency has advised residents to be aware of a killer bird disease after dead ducks were discovered along the River Weaver in Winsford.
    
    DEFRA officials from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) have warned dog walkers to keep their pets away from water following several suspected outbreaks of avian botulism.
    
    Type C avian botulism, though not associated with human disease, [is common] in water birds, with the AHVLA currently investigating several suspected cases across north and central England.
    
    Meadowbank resident Gill Jones lives next to the Weaver at Newbridge. She contacted Defra after noticing that the once-prominent ducks along the stretch had "disappeared," before making several grim discoveries during the last fortnight.
    
    "During the course of the week, several ducks were found dead each day, either floating in the river or on the riverbank and others still alive in the water, but very lethargic and obviously unwell," said Gill.
    
    "There was only one swan and 2 moorhens alive, compared to at least 30 ducks or more who usually inhabit our stretch of the water."
    
    She added: "There are still no ducks on the river here, and the problem seems to stretch from Vale Royal Locks to Winsford."
    
    A spokesperson for the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) said: "AHVLA is aware of a number of cases of suspected avian botulism in waterbirds in parts of central and northern England."
    
    "Our investigations so far have found no evidence of a notifiable animal disease or risk to human health. As a precaution, we would advise dog walkers to keep their pets away from birds and water and to prevent their dogs from attacking any sick or weak birds. AHVLA investigates several incidents of suspected avian botulism in waterbirds each year in England and Wales. The disease is not unusual, and it may be associated with deaths in wild birds."
    
    Elsewhere near Newbridge, the Environment Agency is testing a small lake for blue-green algae, the suspected cause of a large fish-kill in 2012 that decimated fish stocks.
