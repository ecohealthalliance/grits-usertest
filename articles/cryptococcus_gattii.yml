    An emerging pathogen, once thought to be restricted to the Pacific Northwest, has appeared in New York State, a researcher said. In an unusual case, researchers isolated Cryptococcus gattii from the cerebrospinal fluid and adrenal tissue of a 72 year old lumberyard worker, according to Katie Warren, DO, of Albany Medical College in New York State. The man had never been outside New York and had no links to the Pacific Northwest in particular, Warren reported here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.
    
    While the source of the infection hasn't been pinned down, Warren told MedPage Today, suspicion centers on the man's work environment, since C. gattii is known to colonize wood. The finding "might represent a shift" in where the pathogen is likely to be found, Warren said.
    
    But an outside expert told MedPage Today the finding might not represent an expansion of the fungal range but instead an improved ability to separate C. gattii from its close cousin Cryptococcus neoformans.
    
    "The pathogen has been, over the years, difficult to separate from Cryptococcus neoformans, and we're starting to recognize it's found in a lot of places we didn't look for it previously," said Nancy Wengenack, PhD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Because of the improved ability to diagnose C. gattii, "I expect we'll continue to see cases in different states in the USA and probably elsewhere," Wengenack said. Both pathogens can cause disease, she said, but C. neoformans usually attacks immunosuppressed people, while C. gattii can cause disease in people with an intact immune system.
    
    C. gattii had been thought to be mainly a tropical pathogen until the early years of this century, when it was discovered in the Pacific Northwest, causing more than 200 cases on Vancouver Island in Canada, and then about 100 cases in Oregon and Washington state. But the CDC has reported at least 25 cases outside of the region, including in California, Florida, and Georgia, among other places. The lumber worker appears to be the 1st case in the Northeast, Warren said, which suggests, among other things, that labs in the region testing for fungal infection should consider C. gattii, rather than just C. neoformans.
    
    Interestingly, Warren said, the man did not present with the classical respiratory symptoms of C. gattii infection -- shortness of breath, cough, and fever. Instead, he complained of slurred speech, which prompted physicians to think of a stroke or transient ischemic attack.
    
    A neurologic exam as part of the standard stroke work-up was unremarkable, Warren said, but CT imaging found a small mass at the C1 level of the spinal cord, as well as a bilateral adrenal nodularity. Testing with polymerase chain reaction found C. gattii in the cerebrospinal fluid and in adrenal tissue, she said, and the man was treated with 2 weeks of lipid-formulated amphotericin-B and 2 years of fluconazole. He has now cleared the infection and is clinically well.
