    A previous healthy 41 year old man presented to the National Center for Global Health and Medicine on 4 Aug [2014] with complaint of a 3 day history of fever, headache, and rash, after returning from traveling in Thailand. He had visited Ko Samui [Surat Thani Province], an island in Thailand, from 25-31 Jul 2014, for sightseeing. He did not use insect repellent during his trip.
    
    At the initial presentation, his body temperature was 37.2 deg C [about 99 deg F], physical examination revealed bilateral nonpurulent conjunctivitis, maculopapular rash on the face, trunk, and extremities, including his palms and soles. Other examinations were normal. We sent his blood sample to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases. Elevation of serum IgM [immunoglobulin M] antibody for Zika virus was confirmed at his 2nd presentation, thus we made the diagnosis of Zika fever. His fever and other symptoms subsided a few days after the initial presentation and his rash and conjunctivitis had gradually disappeared within a week.
    
    Zika fever is a dengue-like illness transmitted by mosquitoes. It was originally detected in Africa; however, recent cases have been reported from Oceania and Southeast Asia, including French Polynesia, Micronesia, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Thailand. There were a few reports of Zika fever in travellers returning from Thailand.
    
    This case can indicate wide geographical distribution in the Southeast Asia. Zika fever should be considered in febrile patients with rash returning from Thailand.
